# Given an array of integers where 1 â‰¤ a[i] â‰¤ n (n = size of array), some 
# elements appear twice and others appear once.

# Find all the elements of [1, n] inclusive that do not appear in this array.

# Could you do it without extra space and in O(n) runtime? You may assume the 
# returned list does not count as extra space.

# Example:
# Input:
# [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]
# Output:
# [5,6]

# ----------------------------------------------
# Ideas: Using array values as indices, mark
# nums[num - 1] as seen when encounter num

# Considerations: 

# Complexity: O(n) time, O(1) space
# ----------------------------------------------
